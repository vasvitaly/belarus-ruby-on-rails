# Belarus Ruby User Group

Belarusian Ruby User Group - Ruby-developer community, created for the exchange of ideas and experiences. We are also interested in the development of Ruby in our country and help each other to build a successful IT-career.

## Development

To run application on your local:

    mailcatcher
    rake sunspot:solr:start
    rails s
    rake jobs:work

You might need to install java:

    apt-get update
    apt-get upgrade
    apt-get install python-software-properties
    add-apt-repository ppa:ferramroberto/java
    apt-get update
    apt-get install sun-java6-jre sun-java6-plugin

### Tests

Standard RSpec tests are used for testing the application. At first, start solr:

    RAILS_ENV=test rake sunspot:solr:start

The tests can be run with:

    bundle exec rake spec

or simple `rspec spec`.
